# Contributing to Vinena

First of all, thank you for _even_ considering on contributing to Vinena. It's well appreciated! Vinena started as my personal side project for learning purposes and I decided we can learn together by building a complete UI library collectively!

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## Ways to contribute

- **Give feedback:** I'm constantly working on making Vinena better, please share how you use Vinena, what features are missing and what is done good via [Github Issues](https://github.com/mert-duzgun/vinena-ui/issues)

- **Contribute to Figma:** I'm also designing everything from scratch. If you are a UI/UX designer or learning to be one, you can help me with designing components in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/zxtzS9qnQXPN2PHs6Q76vN/Vinena-UI). Ask for Figma access from your preferred [communication channel](https://duzgun.dev#contact)

- **Contribute to codebase:** propose a new feature via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mert-duzgun/vinena-ui/issues) or find an [existing one](https://github.com/mert-duzgun/vinena-ui/labels/help%20wanted) that you are interested in and work on it

- **Give us a code review:** help us identify problems with [source code](https://github.com/mert-duzgun/vinena-ui/tree/main/src) or make Vinena more performant

## Contributing workflow

- Decide what you want to contribute
- If you want to implement new feature open an issue first and discuss it with us
- After finalizing issue details, fork the repository and create a new branch from `dev` branch
- Make your changes and commit them with [commit convention](#commit-convention)
- Run tests with `yarn test` and submit a PR if everything is fine
- Get a code review and fix all issues noticed by maintainer
- If you cannot finish your task or changed your mind â€“ that's totally fine, just let us know in GitHub issue that you've created in first step. We won't judge or ask any questions if you decide to cancel your submission
- Your PR is merged, you are awesome!

## Commit convention

- Commit message should be in imperative mood, e.g. "Add button component" instead of "Added button component"
- Commit message should be short and descriptive, e.g. "Add button component" instead of "Add button component that has primary color and can be used to submit forms"
